  about: |
    High Tide was a self-started online multiplayer survival game co-developed with a friend. Players built castles and competed on official servers. The world underwent server wipes triggered by an incoming tide, forcing naval combat during these events. The project spanned 18-24 months and was my first serious game project, where I gained deep experience in Unity3D, networking, and gameplay systems.
