journey:
  - "I'm a Game Developer and AI enthusiast with a deep-seated passion for building intelligent systems and engaging, data-driven game worlds. My journey began in 2016 not just as a player, but as a creator."
  - "That curiosity led me to develop and manage <strong>Pirate Era</strong>, a Minecraft MMORPG server that grew to over 30,000 members. This long-term project was my real-world classroom, teaching me everything from server architecture and custom plugin development to managing SQL databases and using Python tools to analyze player behavior and balance gameplay."
  - "To formalize my self-taught skills, I pursued a propaedeutic in Software Engineering, which I passed with Cum Laude distinction. This solidified my engineering foundation and led me to the University of Amsterdam. There, I completed my BSc in Artificial Intelligence, served as a Teaching Assistant for core computer science courses, and volunteered with the Dutch Nao Team."
  - "Now, I'm currently expanding my expertise in my <strong>MSc in Artificial Intelligence</strong> at the University of Amsterdam, focusing on advanced machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Skills I'm eager to apply to the next generation of intelligent systems and game development challenges."
